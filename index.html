A leader needs to know the nuances." }, { text: "Provide the records, because the student is still attending a secondary school.", isCorrect: false, feedback: "Attendance at a secondary school is not the deciding factor once a student turns 18." }, { text: "Deny the request immediately and inform the student of the parent's attempt to access their records.", isCorrect: false, feedback: "This creates an adversarial situation and misinterprets the law's exceptions." }, { text: "Inform the parent that the district's policy allows access if they can provide evidence that the student is a dependent for tax purposes, in accordance with the FERPA exception.", isCorrect: true, isBest: true, feedback: "Correct. FERPA allows schools to disclose records to parents of a dependent student over 18. A leader knows the exceptions and has a policy to address them." } ]},

This is the core requirement of CIPA for E-Rate eligibility.

A subpoena is not the same as a warrant, and FERPA has specific procedures." }, { text: "Refuse to comply as student records are protected by FERPA.", isCorrect: false, feedback: "This is incorrect. FERPA allows for disclosure under certain legal orders, but with specific steps." }, { text: "Contact the district's legal counsel to review the subpoena and ensure compliance with FERPA's requirement to make a reasonable effort to notify the parent or eligible student before complying.", isCorrect: true, isBest: true, feedback: "Correct.

A leader must consider the profound ethical implications of surveillance technology, including accuracy, bias, and the creation of a culture of mistrust, well beyond the technical implementation." }, { text: "Whether the cameras are high enough resolution.", isCorrect: false, feedback: "This is a technical specification, not an ethical concern." }, { text: "How much data storage will be required for the video feeds.", isCorrect: false, feedback: "This is a logistical and budget concern, not the primary ethical one." } ]},

A leader must understand this distinction. You can have perfect security on improperly collected data, which would still be a privacy violation." }, { text: "Privacy is a concern for student data, while security is a concern for financial data.", isCorrect: false, feedback: "Both privacy and security are critical for all types of sensitive data." } ]},

The most effective leadership action is to:", options: [ { text: "Send a single email to all parents at the start of the year with a link to a consent form.", isCorrect: false, feedback: "This is a passive, one-time approach that is unlikely to achieve full compliance or understanding." }, { text: "Delegate the entire consent process to individual teachers.", isCorrect: false, feedback: "This creates inconsistency and places an undue burden on teachers. A leader creates a systemic solution." }, { text: "Develop a systemic process that integrates consent management into the student registration system and provides clear, ongoing communication to parents about the tools being used.", isCorrect: true, isBest: true, feedback: "Correct. A leader builds a sustainable, integrated system for managing compliance and focuses on clear, transparent communication with stakeholders." }, { text: "Stop using all online services to avoid the hassle of compliance.", isCorrect: false, feedback: "This would be a major disservice to students and staff. A leader's role is to manage compliance, not avoid it by sacrificing instructional tools." } ]},

Based on the 'Tinker' standard, schools may have authority over off-campus speech if it is likely to cause a substantial disruption at school. A leader must understand this legal principle." }, { text: "A personal matter that the school has no authority to address.", isCorrect: false, feedback: "This is incorrect. The use of a school device and the nature of the threat can bring it into the school's jurisdiction." } ]},

A leader must be able to articulate this VOI." }, { text: "Calculate an ROI based on the potential lifetime earnings of the students who will use the technology.", isCorrect: false, feedback: "This is highly speculative and not a credible way to justify the investment to a board." }, { text: "Promise that the investment will lead to a reduction in the number of special education staff needed.", isCorrect: false, feedback: "This is an inappropriate and likely false claim.

As a leader, you use this data to:", options: [ { text: "Justify the purchase of the more expensive but more durable device, explaining that it has a lower TCO.", isCorrect: true, isBest: true, feedback: "Correct.
