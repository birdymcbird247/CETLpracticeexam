The student has not given consent. According to FERPA, how should the district respond?", options: [ { text: "Deny the request, as the student is over 18 and all FERPA rights have transferred to them.", isCorrect: true, isBest: false, feedback: "This is the general rule, but FERPA has exceptions. A leader needs to know the nuances." }, { text: "Provide the records, because the student is still attending a secondary school.", isCorrect: false, feedback: "Attendance at a secondary school is not the deciding factor once a student turns 18." }, { text: "Deny the request immediately and inform the student of the parent's attempt to access their records.", isCorrect: false, feedback: "This creates an adversarial situation and misinterprets the law's exceptions." }, { text: "Inform the parent that the district's policy allows access if they can provide evidence that the student is a dependent for tax purposes, in accordance with the FERPA exception.", isCorrect: true, isBest: true, feedback: "Correct.

A subpoena is not the same as a warrant, and FERPA has specific procedures." }, { text: "Refuse to comply as student records are protected by FERPA.", isCorrect: false, feedback: "This is incorrect. FERPA allows for disclosure under certain legal orders, but with specific steps." }, { text: "Contact the district's legal counsel to review the subpoena and ensure compliance with FERPA's requirement to make a reasonable effort to notify the parent or eligible student before complying.", isCorrect: true, isBest: true, feedback: "Correct.

A leader follows an established plan. The primary responsibility is to manage the incident and ensure affected parties are notified according to legal requirements." }, { text: "To issue a press release blaming the vendor for the breach.", isCorrect: false, feedback: "Public communication is important, but blaming is not the first or most professional step." } ]},

The most effective leadership action is to:", options: [ { text: "Send a single email to all parents at the start of the year with a link to a consent form.", isCorrect: false, feedback: "This is a passive, one-time approach that is unlikely to achieve full compliance or understanding." }, { text: "Delegate the entire consent process to individual teachers.", isCorrect: false, feedback: "This creates inconsistency and places an undue burden on teachers. A leader creates a systemic solution." }, { text: "Develop a systemic process that integrates consent management into the student registration system and provides clear, ongoing communication to parents about the tools being used.", isCorrect: true, isBest: true, feedback: "Correct. A leader builds a sustainable, integrated system for managing compliance and focuses on clear, transparent communication with stakeholders." }, { text: "Stop using all online services to avoid the hassle of compliance.", isCorrect: false, feedback: "This would be a major disservice to students and staff. A leader's role is to manage compliance, not avoid it by sacrificing instructional tools." } ]},

This is an example of:", options: [ { text: "A CIPA violation.", isCorrect: false, feedback: "CIPA is about filtering content accessed at school, not about student speech created outside of school." }, { text: "A FERPA violation.", isCorrect: false, feedback: "FERPA is about the privacy of educational records, not student speech." }, { text: "A situation where the school may have a responsibility to intervene because the off-campus speech could cause a substantial disruption on campus.", isCorrect: true, isBest: true, feedback: "Correct. Based on the 'Tinker' standard, schools may have authority over off-campus speech if it is likely to cause a substantial disruption at school. A leader must understand this legal principle." }, { text: "A personal matter that the school has no authority to address.", isCorrect: false, feedback: "This is incorrect.

This is the definition of the Principle of Least Privilege. A leader implements this to reduce the risk of both accidental and malicious data exposure." }, { text: "The least senior employees should have the most restricted access.", isCorrect: false, feedback: "Access should be based on job function (role-based access), not seniority." }, { text: "The district should purchase the least expensive security software.", isCorrect: false, feedback: "This is a poor financial strategy, not a security principle." } ]},

A leader focuses on mitigation and support." }, { text: "Ask the staff members who received the email to delete it immediately.", isCorrect: true, isBest: false, feedback: "This is a good, immediate step for containment, but it's not the complete first action." }, { text: "Activate the district's incident response plan, which includes immediate steps for containment (like recalling the email if possible) and notification of affected parties.", isCorrect: true, isBest: true, feedback: "Correct. A leader does not improvise in a crisis. They follow a pre-established incident response plan to ensure all steps are taken methodically and legally." }, { text: "Do nothing, as it was sent internally and was an accident.", isCorrect: false, feedback: "This is incorrect.

A leader must be able to articulate this VOI." }, { text: "Calculate an ROI based on the potential lifetime earnings of the students who will use the technology.", isCorrect: false, feedback: "This is highly speculative and not a credible way to justify the investment to a board." }, { text: "Promise that the investment will lead to a reduction in the number of special education staff needed.", isCorrect: false, feedback: "This is an inappropriate and likely false claim.

As a leader, you use this data to:", options: [ { text: "Justify the purchase of the more expensive but more durable device, explaining that it has a lower TCO.", isCorrect: true, isBest: true, feedback: "Correct. A leader uses TCO to make fiscally responsible, long-term decisions, demonstrating that the upfront price is only one part of the overall cost." }, { text: "Purchase the cheaper device anyway to save money in the current budget year.", isCorrect: false, feedback: "This is a short-sighted decision that will cost the district more in the long run." }, { text: "Ask the vendor of the cheaper device to lower their price even further.", isCorrect: false, feedback: "While negotiation is good, it doesn't change the fundamental issue of the device's poor durability and high TCO." }, { text: "Cancel the device refresh altogether because it's too expensive.", isCorrect: false, feedback: "This ignores the educational need.
