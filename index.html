A leader needs to know the nuances." }, { text: "Provide the records, because the student is still attending a secondary school.", isCorrect: false, feedback: "Attendance at a secondary school is not the deciding factor once a student turns 18." }, { text: "Deny the request immediately and inform the student of the parent's attempt to access their records.", isCorrect: false, feedback: "This creates an adversarial situation and misinterprets the law's exceptions." }, { text: "Inform the parent that the district's policy allows access if they can provide evidence that the student is a dependent for tax purposes, in accordance with the FERPA exception.", isCorrect: true, isBest: true, feedback: "Correct.

A leader justifies instructional technology by its VOI—its alignment with the core educational mission—not just by direct financial returns." }, { text: "By explaining that the TCO is lower due to reduced server maintenance, even if the license is more.", isCorrect: true, isBest: false, feedback: "TCO is an important part of the justification, but focusing on the VOI (the instructional value) is more strategically compelling for a board." }, { text: "By creating a report showing that all of our peer districts are using this new, more expensive LMS.", isCorrect: false, feedback: "Following trends is not a strategic justification.

A leader builds capacity, not burnout." }, { text: "Delegate responsibility by empowering your team through a clear ticketing and escalation process, freeing you to focus on leadership tasks.", isCorrect: true, isBest: true, feedback: "Correct. A LEADER delegates, builds systems, and empowers their team. This is a core concept of the CETL framework." }, { text: "Ask the superintendent to hire an assistant for you.", isCorrect: false, feedback: "This adds cost without addressing the root problem of a poor workflow and lack of delegation." }, { text: "Personally train a few key teachers to handle these issues in their buildings.", isCorrect: true, isBest: false, feedback: "This is a form of delegation, but it's a tactical fix.

A leader communicates openly." }, { text: "Blame the vendor for the complexity and delays in a public update.", isCorrect: false, feedback: "A leader takes ownership and focuses on solutions, not blame." }, { text: "Clearly explain the risk, which is the probability of the project failing to meet its timeline and budget, and present a revised plan with a more realistic timeline and resource allocation.", isCorrect: true, isBest: true, feedback: "Correct. A leader's job is to assess and explain risk to stakeholders and then propose a clear, revised path forward. This builds trust and shows competent management." }, { text: "Cancel the project to avoid any further risk of failure.", isCorrect: false, feedback: "This is a reactive, not a strategic, response.

Leadership is about influence, not just authority." }, { text: "Ask for permission from building principals to introduce it to their staff.", isCorrect: false, feedback: "A leader doesn't always ask for permission to lead. They build consensus and demonstrate value." }, { text: "Model its use by running your own team meetings and sharing strategic documents on the platform, providing a clear example of its value.", isCorrect: true, isBest: true, feedback: "Correct. A leader models the behavior they want to see. Providing a powerful example is more effective than any mandate." }, { text: "Wait for teachers to discover it on their own.", isCorrect: false,feedback: "This is passive and not a form of leadership." } ]},

SCORM is the industry standard that enables interoperability between learning content and Learning Management Systems, allowing for tracking and reporting." }, { text: "TCP/IP", isCorrect: false, feedback: "TCP/IP is the fundamental communication protocol for the internet, not a learning content standard." }, { text: "SQL", isCorrect: false, feedback: "SQL is a language for managing databases, not for packaging and sharing learning content." } ]},

The new work must add something new, with a further purpose or different character." }, { text: "Gives credit to the original artist in the video.", isCorrect: false, feedback: "Giving credit (attribution) is ethically important but is not a legal defense against a copyright infringement claim.
